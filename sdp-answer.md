# Introduction
WebRTC 1.0 identifies [SDP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566) as the standard that should be used for media negotiation between peers.

# Chrome payload
This is an example of the SDP payload **received in the TU Go web client as part of the 200 OK after sending an offer from the client running on Chrome version 47** (answered coming from the server side).

The following lines describe the meaning of each attribute in the SDP payload.
This information is heavily inspired by [WebRTC Hacks page](https://webrtchacks.com/sdp-anatomy/).

| Field        | Meaning           |
|:-------------|------------------|
| v=0          | **Version of SDP** being used. |
| o=FreeSWITCH 1457608949 1457608950 IN IP4 91.220.9.62 | `o` stands for **[origin](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#section-5.2)**. <br/>First parameter identifies the WebRTC Gateway that TU Go is using. TU Go is heavily based in FreeSWITCH. <br/>The first number, `1457608949`, is the **session id**, an unique identifier for the session.<br/>The second number, `1457608950`, is the **session version**: if a new offer/answer negotiation is needed during this media session, this number will be increased by one. This will happen when any parameter need to be changed in the media session, such as on-hold, codec-change, add/remove media track. <br/>Following the session version are the **network type** (Internet in this case, identified by means of `IN`), **IP address type** (version 4, `IP4`) and **unicast address** of the server component which created the SDP, `91.220.9.62`.
| s=FreeSWITCH | The `s` line contains a **textual session name**.|
| c=IN IP4 91.220.9.62 | `c` is a **connection line**.<br/>First two parameters indicate the **network type** (`IN`, Internet), and the **IP address type** (`IP4`, version 4). Last but not least, this line gives the IP from where you expect to send and receive the real time traffic. TU Go server side is introducing here the public IP that will be used for media exchange.|
|t=0 0|It defines the **[starting and ending time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#page-17)**. These values are the decimal representation of Network Time Protocol (NTP) time values in seconds since 1900. When they are both set to 0 it means that the session is not bounded to a specific time window, which is the usual behaviour.|
|a=msid-semantic: WMS f5XrzL1UaZzKAsB1omPT95MKtbiISTXX| This line gives an **unique identifier for the [WebRTC Media Stream (WMS)](http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#stream-api)** during the PeerConnection’s life. This identifier will be used in the `a=msid` attribute for each m-line belonging to a specific Media Stream (in our case the audio m-line). This means that the RTP media stream (identified by the SSRC field present in every RTP packet) belongs to that media stream and that it is a track of that media stream. It is an explicit association of an individual RTP media stream to the MediaStream WebRTC object. For more info about this refer to [draft-ietf-mmusic-msid](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftools.ietf.org%2Fhtml%2Fdraft-ietf-mmusic-msid&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF3Ka5lbcfa267-bsph5gaufuDfHg).|
|m=audio 15520 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 111 126 106| `m` means it is a **media line**. It condenses a lot of information on the media attributes of the stream. In this order, it tells us:<br/>- `audio`: the media type that is going to be used for the session. Media types are registered at the IANA.<br/>- `15520`: the port that is going to be used for SRTP (and for RTCP if RTCP multiplex is supported by the other peer).<br/>- `UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF`: the transport protocol to be used for the session.<br/>- `111 126 106`: the media format descriptions supported by the browser to send and receive media.<br/>`RTP/SAVPF` is defined in [RFC5124](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5124). It specifies the combination of two profiles, one to enable secure real-time communications (SAVP) and the other to provide timely feedback from the receivers to a sender (AVPF). `UDP/TLS` is used to define that the RTP/SAVPF stream is transported over DTLS with UDP. <br/>**Media format** gives the RTP payload numbers that are going to be used for the different formats. Payload numbers higher than 95 are dynamic and it means we'll need a dedicated `a=rtpmap` line to identify each format. We will see below how `a=rtpmap:` attributes are used for mapping from the RTP payload type numbers to media encoding names (i.e. 111 identifies OPUS). There are also `a=fmtp:` attributes, which are used to specify format parameters.|
|a=rtpmap:111 opus/48000/2| Now we come to the **rtpmap lines** for the formats included in the `m` line above. This is required for mapping the payload types and the codecs. <br/>**[Opus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_%28audio_codec%29)** is one of the MTI audio codecs for WebRTC. It features a variable bit rate (6kbps-510kbps) and is not under any royalty so it can be freely implemented in any browser (unlike other codecs like as G.729). Opus support is starting to become common and it has become critical for most WebRTC applications.|
|a=fmtp:111 useinbandfec=1; minptime=10| SDP payload includes **fmtp lines** to describe characteristics of the offered codecs. The order in which the formats are written in the media line is important as *it defines the priority in which the browsers would like to use them*.<br/>A `minptime` line indicates the **minimum packetization time** the decoder should expect to receive for Opus. If no value is specified, 3 is assumed as default.<br/>`useinbandfec` specifies that the decoder has the capability to take advantage of the Opus in-band FEC ([Forward Error Correction](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-spittka-payload-rtp-opus-03#page-6)). Possible values are 1 and 0. If no value is specified, useinbandfec is assumed to be 0.
|a=rtpmap:126 telephone-event/8000<br/>a=rtpmap:106 CN/8000 --> @Comms: why is 106 and not 13 if the codec is CN/8000?|Following those lines are the `rtpmap` lines mapping to the rest of lower priority codecs that the caller is offering.<br/>- **telephone-event**: this line indicates the browser supports [RFC4733](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4733), allowing it to send DTMFs (dual-tone multifrequency), other tone signals, and telephony events in RTP packets within the RTP not as the usual digitized sine waves but as a special payload (in this case with payload `126` in the RTP packet). This DTMF mechanism ensure that DTMFs will be transmitted independently of the audio codec and the signaling protocol.<br/>- **CN**: There're several lines to define the Comfort Noise payload mapping. Static payload type, `13`, is used whenever using codecs whose RTP timestamp clock rate is 8000 Hz, such as PCMU and PCMA. But as we're including additional codecs with different RTP timestamp clock rate (ISAC), a dynamic payload type mapping (rtpmap attribute) is required (rtpmap `105` and `106`). Note that [use of comfort noise with Opus is discouraged](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7587).|
|a=ptime:20| The `ptime`, **packetization time**, refers to the media duration, in milliseconds, to include in each RTP packet. This has important implications on the effects of packet loss and in the overhead for the stream.|
|a=fingerprint:sha-256 A5:53:D0:1F:FF:C9:56:CA:<br/>C9:7B:3B:5B:8D:2B:EE:D0:<br/>40:96:A5:BE:67:64:EE:3D:<br/>2D:04:42:B2:01:19:68:58 | This `fingerprint` is the result of a hash function (using `sha-256` in this case) of the certificates used in the **[DTLS-SRTP negotiation](https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-must-implement-dtls-srtp-but-must-not-implement-sdes/)**. This line creates a binding between the signaling (which is supposed to be trusted) and the certificates used in DTLS, if the fingerprint doesn’t match, then the session should be rejected.|
|a=setup:active| This parameter means that this peer can be the server of the DTLS negotiation. This parameter was initially defined in [RFC4145](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4145), which has been updated by [RFC4572](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4572).|
|a=rtcp-mux|This lines means that this peer **supports [multiplexing RTCP with RTP traffic](http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5761)**.|
|a=rtcp:15520 IN IP4 91.220.9.62|This line explicitly specifies the IP and port that will used for RTCP (same values as RTP).|
|a=ssrc:2532120207 cname:OLfem6YnWoYnGpeV<br/>a=ssrc:2532120207 msid:f5XrzL1UaZzKAsB1omPT95MKtbiISTXX a0<br/>a=ssrc:2532120207 mslabel:f5XrzL1UaZzKAsB1omPT95MKtbiISTXX<br/>a=ssrc:2532120207 label:f5XrzL1UaZzKAsB1omPT95MKtbiISTXXa0|**SSRC** stands for Synchronization Source and it is an unique identifier of the RTP media stream source. These lines establish a relationship between the SSRC flow identifier, an older RTP concept, to a WebRTC Media Stream, a newer WebRTC concept.<br/>The `cname` source attribute associates a media source with its [Canonical End-Point Identifier](http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1889/24.htm) which will remain constant for the RTP media stream. This is the value that the media sender will place in its [RTCP SDES packets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550#section-6.5).<br/>The `msid` source attribute is used to signal the association between the RTP concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of `media stream/media stream track` using SDP signaling ([draft-ietf-mmusic-msid](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-msid)). The first number, *2532120207*, is the SSRC identifier that will be included in the SSRC field of the RTP packets. Following `msid:` we have the unique identifier included  in the semantic.<br/>The `mslabel` attribute: It looks like a [deprecated attribute](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webrtc/2014Sep/0058.html).<br/>The `label` attribute carries a pointer to a RTP media stream in the context of an arbitrary network application that uses SDP. This label can be used to refer to each particular media stream in its context.
|a=ice-ufrag:BTEBOhb7ikG04uOJ<br/>a=ice-pwd:5TNhQCvCQjPnyT80DDsiKufT|Next we have the **ICE lines**, which is the mechanism chosen for NAT traversal in WebRTC. You can find a very didactic and comprehensive explanation of ICE by [@saghul](https://www.twitter.com/saghul) [here](http://www.slideshare.net/saghul/ice-4414037).<br/>Once the **ICE candidates** are exchanged, a verification process starts where both browsers try to reach each other using the candidates provided.<br/>The **ice-ufgra** and **ice-pwd** credentials are used in that process to avoid receiving potentials attacks from endpoints that are not involved in the session who could potentially create a media session without authorization.
|a=candidate:0603174798 1 udp 659136 91.220.9.62 15520 typ host generation 0| With this line, the server is giving its host candidate, it means, the IP of the interface the server is listening. The browser can send and receive SRTP and SRTCP to that IP in case there is IP visibility with some candidate of the local peer.<br/>The first number in the candidate line is the **foundation**, an identifier used within the ICE session in the process to discover valid candidates (specifically in the [ICE frozen algorithm](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245#section-2.4)). <br/>The number before the protocol (udp) determines the **component**; `1` is for RTP and `2` is for RTCP. <br/>The number after the protocol (udp) - `659136` - is the priority of the candidate. Notice that priority of `host` candidates is higher than other candidates as using host candidates is more efficient in terms of resources usage. Note that TCP candidates get lower `priority` than UDP ones, as TCP is not optimal for real-time media transportation. The couple public IP-port are included after the priority.
