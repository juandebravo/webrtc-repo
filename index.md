WebRTC 1.0 identifies [SDP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566)
as the standard that should be used for media negotiation between peers.

In the links below you can find examples of the SDP generated by both Chrome and
Firefox for sending/receiving an offer/answer.

- [SDP offer](sdp-offer)
- [SDP answer](sdp-answer)
